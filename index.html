            <h3>Frozen Pizza</h3>
            <p>You can't go wrong with a classic frozen pizza! Enjoy a tasty Grandiosa or a juicy Big One. The perfect
            meal for a student, both easy, cheap, and delicious. Just remember that there is such a thing as too much
                of a good thing!</p>

            <h3>Homemade Pizza</h3>
            <p>So you're a crafty guy/girl that can make a pizza yourself? Swell! Just make (or buy!) a dough, and get
            crafty with the topping. I can recommend a nice pepperoni/beef mix, or the classic with rocket salad and
            parmesan. You can also experiment with different cheeses and spices. Find your favorite and enjoy it!</p>

            <h3>Italian Style Pizza</h3>
            <p>So your taste in pizza is a bit more on the expensive side? Not much can beat a good italian style pizza,
             with a crunchy crust and savory topping. Not everyone has a stone-oven in their home, but this can be
             circumvented with either a pizza stone or an appliance like the Pizza Dragon from OBH Nordica (The writer
             of this article highly recommends it!)</p>

            <h3>Restaurants in Trondheim</h3>
            <p>So you got money burning in your pocket? Why not let someone else make your pizza? There are multiple
             tiers of pizza in Trondheim, ranging from Una Pizzeria on Solsiden to the Pizzabakeren spread around the
            city. Everyone got a preference, and you are free to choose whichever you like.</p>
